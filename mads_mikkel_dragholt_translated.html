  <section id="about">
    <p>My name is <strong>Mads Mikkel Dragholt</strong>. I am passionate about ensuring proper conditions in social and disability services. I am a former spokesperson for Autism Youth and have, among other things, worked at Reden Ung, Settlementet and WeShelter.</p>

    <p>This has given me insight into how we can create better frameworks for the people who need help most in our city.</p>

    <p>My political engagement stems from a strong belief that Copenhagen should be a city where everyone has the opportunity to live a good life. For me, politics is about listening, cooperating and turning words into action. If you share my vision for a more inclusive, embracing and humane city, I hope you will vote for me. Let's create a Copenhagen that is for everyone.</p>

    <h2>MY MAIN ISSUES</h2>

    <h3>A TRUST-BASED AND HUMAN-CENTERED SYSTEM</h3>
    <p>– People in vulnerable situations and citizens with disabilities often encounter a mistrustful and bureaucratic system when they need help. That must change!</p>

    <h3>COMBAT CHILD PROSTITUTION</h3>
    <p>– 3.5% of students in 9th grade have sold sexual services. We have a responsibility to ensure that no child sells their body. Detection, prevention and immediate assistance are the way forward!</p>

    <h3>INCLUSION WITH THE CHILD AT THE CENTER</h3>
    <p>– Inclusion classes must be established where there are the right competencies and enough resources to include students with special needs. In addition, it should be made easier to attend a special school.</p>

    <h3>I ALSO WORK FOR:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>More and better housing offers.</li>
      <li>A strengthened effort against homelessness.</li>
      <li>A dignified life for people with intellectual disabilities.</li>
    </ul>
